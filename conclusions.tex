\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we address the problem of inserting user preferences in the discovery of declarative process models as a two-class supervised task. In particular we extend the \nd binary miner for the \declare modeling language with preferences over \declare patterns and activities appearing in the model (plus a combination of the two). 
The computation of preferred models, which take onto account the constraints posed by the user is performed using \asprin, a general framework for computing optimal answer sets of logic programs with preferences. The provided approach is described by means of motivating examples and an application to the real-life event logs DREYERS and CERV.
